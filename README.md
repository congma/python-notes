This repository is a collection of my interactive notes on Python.  They are
Jupyter notebooks, i.e. JSON files available for interactive viewing using
Jupyter notebook viewer.  They can also be viewed using the [`nbviewer`
service hosted by
ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/congma/python-notes/tree/master/).
