    "## Problem ##\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been some arguments and confusion about this simple question:  Which is faster for filtering a list by a predicate, [list comprehension expression](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-list_comprehension \"Formal definition of Python list comprehension\") (\"listcomp\"), or the built-in [`filter`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#filter \"Python Library Reference: filter\") function?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer depends on the nature of the predicate.  In general, there can be three cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If the predicate can be incorporated into the listcomp as an efficient expression, but has to be implemented as a Python callable as passed to `filter`, listcomp is usually faster.\n",
    "2.  If the predicate is simply \"to be evaluated to True as a boolean\", `filter` is usually the winner.\n",
    "3.  If the predicate must be evaluated by calling some Python callable no matter in listcomp or `filter` call, the latter is usually faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will demonstrate each case by running some examlple code in `IPython`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE:*\n",
    "\n",

It also enables more optimizations such as pre-allocation and highly efficient in-place modification of Python list.\n",
